# Volto-based generic fullstack skeleton

A place to put common files used to develop Plone 5 + Volto based projects.

The idea is to have a central place of useful code and configuration that can
provide a uniform developing experience.

## Getting started on a new project

```sh
bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiberiuichim/fullstack-skeleton/setup.sh)"
```

## Keep your project updated to the common skeleton

To keep up to date with it run:

```
make sync-makefiles
```
